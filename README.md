Thank You Future Ready Talent for the internship opportunity. I have made the chat bot .
My Project Name is TeatBOT-99 for Women health. It will be beneficial for girls and women who hesitate to talk about their self.
I used the azure technologies such as
1)Azure Bot Services
2)Qna MAker
3)API app services
Here I have trained my model using Qna Maker . In Qna Maker I have provided the datasets in the knowledge base.
After that I published my knowledge data ,then I connected to qna portal to Azure web app bot.
In Azure web app bot , I have connected my bot in telegram then it worked very fine.
